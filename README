Contains codes from Chapter 5, from Dromey's Book.

Inside this main folder, are many sub-folders, each of them a separate chapter,as given in book.
Basically, the entire directory structure henceforth is exactly similar to the one given in Dromey.

Nevertheless, there is no need to have Dromey's Book with you.Inside every code,I have written the problem-statment, what the code does.
All codes are __sufficiently__ commented !!

The testing of every code is not done "robustly" !
